\title{Plotting differences between two 1D smooth effects}
\usage{
\method{plotDiff}{mgcv.smooth.1D}(s1, s2, n = 100, trans = identity,
  unconditional = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{s1}{a smooth effect object, extracted using \link[mgcViz:sm]{mgcViz::sm}.}

\item{s2}{another smooth effect object.}

\item{n}{number of grid points used to compute main effects and c.i. lines.
For a nice smooth plot this needs to be several times the estimated degrees of
freedom for the smooth.}

\item{trans}{monotonic function to apply to the smooth and residuals, before plotting.
Monotonicity is not checked.}

\item{unconditional}{if \code{TRUE} then the smoothing parameter uncertainty corrected covariance
matrix is used to compute uncertainty bands, if available.
Otherwise the bands treat the smoothing parameters as fixed.}
}
\value{
An objects of class \code{plotSmooth}.
}
\description{
This method can be used to plot the difference between two 1D
smooth effects. Mainly meant to be used with by-factor smooths.
}
\details{
Let sd be the difference between the fitted smooths, that is: sd = s1 - s2.
sd is a vector of length n, and its covariance matrix is
Cov(sd) = X1\%\emph{\%Sig11\%}\%t(X1) + X2\%\emph{\%Sig22\%}\%t(X2) - X1\%\emph{\%Sig12\%}\%t(X2) - X2\%\emph{\%Sig12\%}\%t(X1),
where: X1 (X2) and Sig11 (Sig22) are the design matrix and the covariance matrix
of the coefficients of s1 (s2), while Sig12 is the cross-covariance matrix between
the coefficients of s1 and s2. To get the confidence intervals we need only diag(Cov(sd)),
which here is calculated efficiently (without computing the whole of Cov(sd)).
