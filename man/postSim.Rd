\title{Posterior simulation from a GAM object}
\usage{
postSim(
  o,
  nsim,
  newdata,
  trans = NULL,
  method = "auto",
  w = NULL,
  offset = NULL,
  savePar = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{o}{the output of a \code{gam()} or \code{bam()} call.}

\item{nsim}{the number of simulated vectors of responses. A positive integer.}

\item{newdata}{Optional new data frame used to perform the simulations. To be passed to \link[mgcv]{predict.gam}.}

\item{trans}{function used to transform or summarize each vector of simulated responses.
It must take a vector as argument, but it can output a vector or a scalar.
Potentially useful for saving storage (e.g. by transforming each simulated vector
to a scalar). If left to \code{NULL} then \code{trans = identity} will be used.}

\item{method}{the method used for the simulation of responses. See \link{simulate.gam}.}

\item{w}{vector of prior weights of each response. See \link{simulate.gam}.}

\item{offset}{numeric vector of offsets. For GAMs with multiple linear predictor (see eg \link[mgcv]{gaulss}) it
must be a list of vectors. If \code{newdata!=NULL} the offsets will be assumed to be zero,
unless their are explicitly provided. If \code{newdata==NULL} the simulations will use the
offsets used during model fitting, unless offset is explicitly provided.}

\item{savePar}{if \code{TRUE} than also the simulated parameters will be returned.}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to \link[mgcv]{vcov.gam}.}
}
\value{
If \code{savePar == FALSE} the function will return a matrix where each column is a vector of
simulated responses or a transformed version of it. If \code{savePar == TRUE} it will return
a list where the \code{$simY} entry will contain the simulated responses and \code{$simBeta}
the simulated parameters.
}
\description{
This method can be used to simulate vectors of responses from the
Gaussian posterior approximation of a gamObject.

\examples{
library(mgcViz)
library(MASS)
b <- gam(accel ~ s(times, k = 20), data = mcycle)

# Simulate list of 10 vectors of responses from posterior, taking into
# account smoothing parameters uncertainty (see ?vcov.gam)
n <- 10
sim <- postSim(o = b, nsim = n, unconditional = TRUE)

# Posterior simulations in grey and data in red
points(mcycle$times, mcycle$accel, col = 2)

# There is clear disagreement between simulations' and data's
# conditional variance, which can be solved using flexible GAMLSS model:
b <- gam(list(accel~s(times, k=20), ~s(times)), data=mcycle, family = gaulss)
sim <- postSim(o = b, nsim = n)
points(mcycle$times, mcycle$accel, col = 2)
