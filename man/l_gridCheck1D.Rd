\title{Checking GAM residuals along one covariate}
\usage{
l_gridCheck1D(gridFun = NULL, n = 20, level = 0.8, stand = "none",
  show.reps = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{gridFun}{function used to summarize the residuals in each bin.
By default it is \code{mean(r)*sqrt(length(r)}, where \code{r} is
the vector of residuals in that bin.}

\item{n}{number of grid intervals.}

\item{level}{the level of the confidence intervals plotted.}

\item{stand}{if \code{none} the residuals in each bin are transformed by \code{gridFun} and
plotted as they are. If \code{sc} the statistics in each bin are scaled and
centered using the simulated stats in that bin. If \code{s} we do only scaling,
if \code{c} only centering.}

\item{show.reps}{if \code{TRUE} the individuals simulated statistics are also plotted.}

\item{...}{graphical arguments to be passed to \code{ggplot2::geom_point}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{gamLayer}
}

\examples{
library(mgcViz);
set.seed(4124)
n <- 1e4
x <- rnorm(n); y <- rnorm(n);

# Residuals are heteroscedastic w.r.t. x
ob <- (x)^2 + (y)^2 + (0.2*abs(x) + 1)  * rnorm(n)
b <- bam(ob ~ s(x,k=30) + s(y, k=30), discrete = TRUE)
b <- getViz(b, nsim = 50)

# Don't see much by looking at mean
check1D(b, "x") + l_gridCheck1D()

# Heteroscedasticity clearly visible here
check1D(b, "x") + l_gridCheck1D(gridFun = sd, stand = "sc") # <- we are scaling and centering
# Last point on the right of the rug seems to indicate that a bin is missing.
# It is not an error, only on observation falls in that bin, hence the
# standard deviation is not defined there.
