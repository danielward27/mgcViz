\title{Visualizing a 2D slice of a smooth effects in 3D}
\usage{
\method{plotRGL}{mgcv.smooth.MD}(x, fix, se = TRUE, n = 40,
  residuals = FALSE, type = "auto", maxpo = 1000, too.far = c(0, NA),
  xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, main = NULL, xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL,
  se.mult = 1, shift = 0, trans = identity, seWithMean = FALSE,
  unconditional = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a smooth effect object, extracted using \link[mgcViz:sm]{mgcViz::sm}.}

\item{fix}{a named vector indicating which variables must be kept fixed and to what values.
When plotting a smooth in (d+2) dimensions, then d variables must be fixed.}

\item{se}{when TRUE (default) upper and lower surfaces are added to the plot at \code{se.mult}
(see below) standard deviations for the fitted surface.}

\item{n}{sqrt of the number of grid points used to compute the effect plot.}

\item{residuals}{if TRUE, then the partial residuals will be added.}

\item{type}{the type of residuals that should be plotted. See \link[mgcViz:residuals.gam]{mgcViz::residuals.gam}.}

\item{maxpo}{maximum number of residuals points that will be plotted.
If number of datapoints > \code{maxpo}, then a subsample of \code{maxpo} points will be taken.}

\item{too.far}{a numeric vector with two entries. The first has the same interpretation
as in \link{plot.mgcv.smooth.2D} and it avoids plotting the smooth effect
in areas that are too far form any observation. The distance will be calculated only
using the variables which are not in \code{fix} (see above). Hence in two dimensions,
not in the full d+2 dimensions. Set it to -1 to plot the whole
smooth. The second entry determines which residuals and covariates pairs are closed
enough to the selected slice. If left to \code{NA} on the 10\% of points which are
closest (in terms of scaled Euclidean distance) to the current slice will be plotted.
Set it to -1 to plot all the residuals.}

\item{xlab}{if supplied then this will be used as the x label of the plot.}

\item{ylab}{if supplied then this will be used as the y label of the plot.}

\item{main}{used as title for the plot if supplied.}

\item{xlim}{if supplied then this pair of numbers are used as the x limits for the plot.}

\item{ylim}{if supplied then this pair of numbers are used as the y limits for the plot.}

\item{se.mult}{a positive number which will be the multiplier of the standard errors
when calculating standard error surfaces.}

\item{trans}{monotonic function to apply to the smooth and residuals, before plotting.
Monotonicity is not checked.}

\item{seWithMean}{if TRUE the component smooths are shown with confidence intervals that
include the uncertainty about the overall mean. If FALSE then the uncertainty
relates purely to the centred smooth itself. Marra and Wood (2012) suggests
that TRUE results in better coverage performance, and this is also suggested
by simulation.}

\item{unconditional}{if \code{TRUE} then the smoothing parameter uncertainty corrected covariance
matrix is used to compute uncertainty bands, if available.
Otherwise the bands treat the smoothing parameters as fixed.}

\item{...}{currently unused.}
}
\value{
Returns \code{NULL} invisibly.

\description{
This method plots an interactive 3D representation of a 2-dimensional
slice of a multi-dimensional smooth effect, using the \link{rgl} package.

\examples{
# Example 1: taken from ?mgcv::te, shows how tensor pruduct deals nicely with 
# badly scaled covariates (range of x 5\% of range of z )
library(mgcViz)
n <- 1e3
x <- rnorm(n); y <- rnorm(n); z <- rnorm(n)

ob <- (x-z)^2 + (y-z)^2 + rnorm(n)
b <- gam(ob ~ s(x, y, z))
v <- getViz(b)

plotRGL(sm(v, 1), fix = c("z" = 0))

rgl.close() # Close

plotRGL(sm(v, 1), fix = c("z" = 1), residuals = TRUE)

# We can still work on the plot, for instance change the aspect ratio
library(rgl)
aspect3d(1, 2, 1)

rgl.close() # Close
