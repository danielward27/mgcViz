\title{Plotting Markov random field smooths}
\usage{
\method{plot}{mrf.smooth}(x, trans = identity, seWithMean = FALSE, unconditional = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a smooth effect object, extracted using \link{sm}.}

\item{trans}{monotonic function to apply to the smooth and residuals, before plotting.
Monotonicity is not checked.}

\item{seWithMean}{if TRUE the component smooths are shown with confidence intervals that
include the uncertainty about the overall mean. If FALSE then the uncertainty
relates purely to the centred smooth itself. Marra and Wood (2012) suggests
that TRUE results in better coverage performance, and this is also suggested
by simulation.}

\item{unconditional}{if \code{TRUE} then the smoothing parameter uncertainty corrected covariance
matrix is used to compute uncertainty bands, if available.
Otherwise the bands treat the smoothing parameters as fixed.}

\item{...}{currently unused.}
}
\value{
An objects of class \code{plotSmooth}.
}
\description{
This is the plotting method for Markov random field smooths.
}
\examples{
library(mgcViz)
## Load Columbus Ohio crime data (see ?columbus for details and credits)
data(columb) ## data frame
data(columb.polys) ## district shapes list
xt <- list(polys = columb.polys) ## neighbourhood structure info for MRF
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
## First a full rank MRF...
b <- gam(crime ~ s(district, bs = "mrf", xt = xt), data = columb, method = "REML")
b <- getViz(b)

# Manual plot
plot(sm(b, 1)) + l_poly(colour = 2) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = heat.colors(50))

# Default plot
plot(b)
