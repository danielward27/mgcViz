#' Generalized Additive Model residuals
#' 
#' @description Extension of \code{mgcv::residuals.gam}. Returns residuals for a fitted gam model object. 
#'              Pearson, deviance, working and response residuals are available as in the method from 
#'              \code{mgcv}, but this version also provides residual types "tunif" and "tnormal". The former are
#'              obtained using the cdf of the response distribution (if available). The latter are obtained
#'              by further transforming the uniform residuals using the quantile function (i.e. the inverse
#'              cdf) of a standard normal variable. 
#' @param object the output of a \code{gam()} or \code{bam()} call.
#' @param type the type of residuals wanted. If should be one of "deviance", "pearson", "scaled.pearson",
#'             "working", "response", "tunif" or "tnormal". Not all are available for each family.
#' @param ... further arguments passed to [mgcv::residuals.gam].
#' @name residuals.gam
#' @seealso See also [mgcv::residuals.gam] for details.
